    short_description: Add certbot hook scripts
    description: |
      This role builds on top of the geerlingguy.certbot role to add
      additional functionality for adding hook scripts.

      Customizable deploy hook scripts can be configured per certificate
      by setting the deploy-hook key which is added to the certbot_certs dict.

      Customizable pre/post hook scripts can be configured via the
      new certbot_pre_hook and certbot_post_hook variables.
    options:
      certbot_pre_hook:
        description: Contents for the pre hook script
        type: str

      certbot_post_hook:
        description: Contents for the post hook script
        type: str
